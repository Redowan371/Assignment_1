                -As this child are unable to study due to their financial conditions of the family.

                -providing them food and every necessity they want.
                -developing their skills in various fields and making them a valuable asset.
                So please fund them by giving donations according to your capability and remind them that even a small amount of donation can make someone smile.</p>
